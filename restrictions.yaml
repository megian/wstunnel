    # This restriction apply only and only if all matchers match/are evaluated to true

    match:
      # This match apply only if it succeeds to match the path prefix with the given regex
      # The regex does a match, so if you want to match exactly you need to bound the pattern with ^ $
      # I.e: "tesotron" is going to match "XXXtesotronXXX", but "^tesotron$" is going to match only "tesotron"
      - !PathPrefix "^.*$"
      # The only other possible match type for now is !Any, that match everything/any request
      # - !Any

    # This is the list of tunnels your restriction is going to allow
    # The list is checked in order, the first match is going to allow the request
    allow:
      # !ReverseTunnel allows reverse tunnels
      # Not specifying anything means all reverse tunnels are allowed
